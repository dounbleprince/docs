## Introduction

WCX offers both REST and WebSocket APIs. This documentation outlines API functionality and provides code examples in the right-side column.

You can use the API to programmatically place new orders, check your balance, or stream real-time price and order book updates, among other things.

All request and response bodies are encoded in JSON (`application/json`). All requests must be made over SSL.
